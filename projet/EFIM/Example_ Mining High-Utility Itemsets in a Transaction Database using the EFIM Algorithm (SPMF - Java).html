<p>What is EFIM?</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>EFIM </strong>(Zida et al., 2015) is an algorithm for
    discovering<strong> high-utility itemsets </strong>in a transaction
    database containing utility information. </p>
  <p><strong>High utility itemset mining </strong>has several
    applications such as discovering groups of items in transactions of a
    store that generate the most profit. A database containing utility
    information is a database where items can have quantities and a unit
    price. Although these algorithms are often presented in the context of
    market basket analysis, there exist other applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the input?</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>EFIM</strong> takes as input a transaction database with
    utility information and a minimum utility threshold <em>min_utility </em>(a
    positive integer)<em>.</em> Let's consider the following database
    consisting of 5 transactions (t1,t2...t5) and 7 items (1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
    6, 7). This database is provided in the text file "<strong>DB_utility.txt</strong>"
    in the package <strong>ca.pfv.spmf.tests </strong>of the SPMF
    distribution<strong>.</strong></p>

    <p>Each line of the <strong>database</strong> is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> a set of items (the first column of the table), </li>
      <li>the sum of the utilities (e.g. profit) of these items in this
        transaction (the second column of the table),</li>
      <li>the utility of each item for this transaction (e.g. profit
        generated by this item for this transaction)(the third column of the
        table).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that the value in the second column for each line is the
      sum of the values in the third column.</p>
    <p>What are real-life examples of such a database? There are
      several applications in real life. One application is a customer
      transaction database. Imagine that each transaction represents the
      items purchased by a customer. The first customer named "<strong>t1</strong>"
      bought items 3, 5, 1, 2, 4 and 6. The amount of money spent for each
      item is respectively 1 $, 3 $, 5 $, 10 $, 6 $ and 5 $. The total amount
      of money spent in this transaction is 1 + 3 + 5 + 10 + 6 + 5 = 30 $.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the output?</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em> </em>The output of<strong> EFIM </strong>is the set of <strong>high
    utility itemset</strong>s having a utility no less than a <em><strong>min_utility</strong></em> threshold (a positive integer) set by the user. To explain what is a
    high utility itemset, it is necessary to review some definitions. An <strong>itemset</strong> is an unordered set of distinct items. The <strong>utility of an
      itemset in a transaction </strong>is the sum of the utility of its
    items in the transaction. For example, the utility of the itemset {1 4}
    in transaction t1 is 5 + 6 = 11 and the utility of {1 4} in transaction
    t3 is 5 + 2 = 7. The<strong> utility of an itemset in a database</strong> is the sum of its utility in all transactions where it appears. For
    example, the utility of {1 4} in the database is the utility of {1 4}
    in t1 plus the utility of {1 4} in t3, for a total of 11 + 7 = 18. A<strong> high utility itemset</strong> is an itemset such that its utility is no
    less than <em>min_utility</em> For example, if we run <strong>FHM </strong>with
    a<strong> minimum utility of 30</strong>, we obtain 8 <strong>high-utility
      itemsets</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the database is a transaction database from a store, we could
    interpret these results as all the groups of items bought together that
    generated a profit of 30 $ or more. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Input file format</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The <strong> input file format</strong> of <strong>EFIM </strong>is
    defined as follows. It is a text file. Each lines represents a
    transaction. Each line is composed of three sections, as follows.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>First, the items contained in the transaction are listed. An
      item is represented by a positive integer. Each item is separated from
      the next item by a single space. It is assumed that all items within a
      same transaction (line) are sorted according to a total order (e.g.
      ascending order) and that no item can appear twice within the same
      transaction.</li>
    <li>Second, the symbol ":" appears and is followed by the
      transaction utility (an integer).</li>
    <li>Third, the symbol ":" appears and is followed by the utility of
      each item in this transaction (an integer), separated by single spaces.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For example, for the previous example, the input file is defined
    as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>3 5 1 2 4 6:30:1 3 5 10 6 5<br>
      3 5 2 4:20:3 3 8 6<br>
      3 1 4:8:1 5 2<br>
      3 5 1 7:27:6 6 10 5<br>
      3 5 2 7:11:2 3 4 2 </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Consider the first line. It means that the transaction {3, 5, 1,
    2, 4, 6} has a total utility of 30 and that items 3, 5, 1, 2, 4 and 6
    respectively have a utility of 1, 3, 5, 10, 6 and 5 in this
    transaction. The following lines follow the same format.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Output file format</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The <strong>output file format</strong> of <strong>EFIM </strong>is
    defined as follows. It is a text file, where each line represents a <strong>high
      utility itemset</strong>. On each line, the items of the itemset are
    first listed. Each item is represented by an integer, followed by a
    single space. After, all the items, the keyword " #UTIL: " appears and
    is followed by the utility of the itemset. For example, we show below
    the output file for this example. </p>
  <p>2 4 #UTIL: 30<br>
    2 5 #UTIL: 31<br>
    1 3 5 #UTIL: 31<br>
    2 3 4 #UTIL: 34<br>
    2 3 5 #UTIL: 37<br>
    2 4 5 #UTIL: 36<br>
    2 3 4 5 #UTIL: 40<br>
    1 2 3 4 5 6 #UTIL: 30 </p>
  <p>For example, the first line indicates that the itemset {2, 4} has
    a utility of 30. The following lines follows the same format.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Performance</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>High utility itemset mining</strong> is a more difficult
    problem than frequent itemset mining. Therefore, high-utility itemset
    mining algorithms are generally slower than frequent itemset mining
    algorithms. </p>
  <p><strong>The EFIM algorithm </strong> was shown to be<strong> up
    to two orders of magnitude faster</strong> than the previous
    state-of-the-art algorithm <strong>FHM, HUI-Miner, d2HUP, UPGrowth+ </strong>(also
    included in SPMF), and consumes<strong> up to four times less memory </strong>(see
    the performance section of the website for a comparison).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Implementation details</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The implementation offered in SPMF is the original implementation
    of <strong>EFIM</strong>.</p>
  <p>In the source code version of SPMF, there are two versions of
    EFIM: one that saves the result to a file (<span class="Style9">MainTestEFIM_saveToFile.java</span>)
    and one that saves the result to memory (<span class="Style9">MainTestEFIM_saveToMemory.java</span>).
    In the graphical interface and command line interface, only the version
    that saves to file is offered.</p>
  <p>Note that the input format is not exactly the same as described in
    the article. But it is equivalent.</p>
